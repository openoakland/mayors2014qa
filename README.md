Oakland Mayors Race 2014 Q&amp;A

We're asking about 15 candidates about 15 questions about their tech-related values and policies. We're building a site to make it easy to understand, discuss, and share their answers. Specifically: 

- Launch by 1 October 2014 
- In a way that: 
  - gives each candidate (and all their answers), each question (with all candidates' answers), and each answer (just one answer from one candidate) their own pages and canonical urls
  - runs in a CMS like WordPress
  - full-text search
  - tags and tagging
  - social sharing
  - disqus or similar threaded commenting
  - mailchimp subscription 
- So that: 
  - voters can learn more about their candidates
  - press have ready quotes
  - people can discuss the issues, suggest improvements, and catch candidates saying the right things
  - OpenOakland can help candidates hold themselves accountable
  - OpenOakland can cultivate public contacts that want to consume/engage/learn more on our issues
